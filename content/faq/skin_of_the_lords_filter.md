Use the one that's best for your build & colours that match your build.

If you are Crit capped, Increased Crit Damage is good
If you have very high damage to inflict 30% chill with Freezing Pulse, then you can use Elemental Focus with Ice Spear
If your Elemental Penetration is low, then Awakened Cold Pen is great.
Experiment the gem link for your build in PoB

Don't use Elemental Focus, if your chill is low. Less than 25.

# How to start the loop?

You use your weapon swap key, on PC that is usually the X key.\
Make sure you have two wands in your weapon swap that have the affix `Triggers Level 20 Spectral Spirits when Equipped`. (Essence of Insanity Craft)

If you for any reasons need to stop the loop, remove your belt or your helmet for a second.

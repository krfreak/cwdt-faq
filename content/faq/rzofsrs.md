```

Put the Summon Skeletons in the top left socket of the weapon/body armour. Put the SRS in the top-right if possible to guarantee a clean loop before everything else. RZoF is only to supplement when other stuff fails the loop so it can be further down in the links.

Remove any Forbidden Rite setup.

Then remove the duration cluster \(Window of Opportunity\) near Magebane and the To Dust jewels from your tree.

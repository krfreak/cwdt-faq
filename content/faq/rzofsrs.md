# Raise Zombie of Falling + Summon Raging Spirit Setup

**Requirements:**

```
Optional: Deadeye Forbidden Flame/Flesh jewels or Deadeye allocated and using Pathfinder Forbidden Flame/Flesh jewels for permanent Tailwind
          might ruin the setup or make it possible -> make sure you don't outrun your zombies!
Important:
6L weapon/chest
27% Cooldown Recovery Setup
2x Heartbound Loop rings
```

**Gems:**

```
  11/20% Summon Skeletons
+  1/23%Summon Raging Spirit
+  5/20% Cast When Damage Taken Support
+  1/ 0% Swift Affliction Support
+ 21/20% Less Duration Support(can be any combination to reach 60% on the reduction value)
+  1/ x% Raise Zombie of Falling (Quality doesn't matter)
```

Put the Summon Skeletons in the top left socket of the weapon/body armour. Put the SRS in the top-right if possible to guarantee a clean loop before everything else. RZoF is only to supplement when other stuff fails the loop so it can be further down in the links.

Remove any Forbidden Rite setup.

Then remove the duration cluster \(Window of Opportunity\) near Magebane and the To Dust jewels from your tree.

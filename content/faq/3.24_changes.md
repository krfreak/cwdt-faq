# Changes

Olroth's quality is now dependent on vaaling flasks for 20%+ quality. It's a random chance to apply -10% to +10% quality to the flask. Look out for a good roll before corrupting!

With flask duration tattoos coming back we can get around this to some degree and just use a 20% quality flask for the time being.

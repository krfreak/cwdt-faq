Look above post/message for crafting without fracture base. This is not the only method. The above is cheaper.

#### Phase 1 - The Fracture

Basee - Stygian Vise 84+

##### Option 1 -

Buy a fractured "20% reduced flask charges used" base,

##### Option 2 -

Buy a Stygian Vise, alterations till you get "20% reduced flask charges used", augment, regal, exalt slam
The belt will now have exactly 4 modifiers.

##### Option 3 -

Buy a Stygian with "20% reduced flask charges used"
If it has 6 or 5 modifiers, annul them. So that it has 4 modifiers only.

Time to fracture

Ensure it has only 4 modifiers, now fracturing orb and Pray

#### Phase 2 - Crafting Flask Duration & CDR

Spam Chaos Orbs till you get 28+ flask duration in suffix,
Buy Aisling and pray for suffix and while keeping the flask duration suffix
Unveil and pray for CDR
Repeat till you get it

Crafting Life Mod
Craft Suffix Cannot Be Changed. (Buy the beast Wild Bristle Matron and kill it. This is cheaper than benchcraft)
Harvest Reforge Life

Repeat till you are happy with life mod

Cost - 30 Divines Very Lucky, 70 Divines Very Unlucky

This is the end game belt you want for Non-Omni Builds
